# Classification Model of Free Flap in Craniomaxillofacial Region Based on Pixel Curve Features
## Introduction
<!--游离皮瓣由皮肤及其相关组织组成，在外科领域具有广泛的应用。这种移植手术能够修复受损组织，改善功能和外观，显著提高患者的生活质量。然而，皮瓣危象是一个不可忽视的问题，可能严重影响病人的生命健康。为了及时发现并抢救皮瓣危象，在临床实践中通常使用多普勒超声、彩色多普勒超声、热成像等技术进行监测。然而，针对颅颌面口腔内部的游离皮瓣监测，现有技术存在一些缺陷。因此，我们提出了一种分类模型，旨在解决上述问题。该模型基于机理模型分析，利用灰度图像的曲线特征对游离皮瓣进行二分类。-->

A free flap consists of skin and its associated tissues, widely utilized in the field of surgery. This transplantation procedure can repair damaged tissues, improve function and appearance, significantly enhancing patients' quality of life. However, flap failure is a critical issue that cannot be ignored, potentially severely impacting patients' health and well-being. To promptly detect and manage flap failure, clinical practice often employs monitoring techniques such as Doppler ultrasound, color Doppler ultrasound, and thermography. However, current methods for monitoring free flaps within the craniofacial region have some limitations. Therefore, we propose a classification model aimed at addressing these issues. This model is based on mechanistic analysis and utilizes curve features of grayscale images for the binary classification of free flaps.

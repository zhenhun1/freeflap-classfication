# Classification Model of Free Flap in Craniomaxillofacial Region Based on Pixel Curve Features
## Introduction
Free flaps are primarily composed of skin and its asso ciated tissues. It is commonly used to fill large defects caused by surgical resection, especially in the removal of tumors or cancerous tissues. In the field of surgical oper ations, craniomaxillofacial surgery imposes particularly strict requirements on the quality of wound recovery, primarily due to the fact that this area not only involves physiological health but also bears significant social functions. In addition, craniomaxillofacial trauma sites are divided into intraoral and extraoral areas, and this unique anatomical location further complicates and challenges the quality monitoring of post transplantation. According to survey data from 2021, there were approximately 148,000 new cases of head and neck can cer diagnosed in China, with nearly 78,000 deaths attributed to this condition, showing an increasing trend.
